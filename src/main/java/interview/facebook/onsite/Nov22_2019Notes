Round 2 : Design
Design a HTTP Resource Load (HRL) which is an App in smart phone to handle all HTTP resource download request from all
various Apps in smart phone. For ex. there are App Stores, Facebook, Chrome, all of them based on HTTP protocol to download
resource from website. The resource can be web page, can be video or pictures, can be a Application. For different resources
requests from different Apps, how HRL handle them.

First it is a standalone Application, not dependent on other website apps or data store. What I designed is a FIFO Queue to
accept all requests from different Apps. For web page, which is not big, we can use RESTful API to take parameters, parameters
including AppId, URL, etc. It should also assign a request ID to this request. So it can return JSON after download data from
URL. Return should be a JSON. Including a plaintext.

For big package, since it will take a while to download, HRL will first return an acknowledge to App, put the request to
the queue, after the download is done, send an notification to the app and the location of the downloaded package.
